We used MVC architecture in our PTM2 Client (containes model,view & controller). The controller implements Observer and the model & view extends the Observable. 
We chose to implement Mvc in order to create a clearly separation of concerns between model and view.

Explanation regard the program: <br/>
Mainwindow controller: handles the user requests and render the appropriate view.<br/>
Pipeview: Display data using the model to the user<br/>
Model: represent the logic behind the pipe game client <br/>

Edit server's information <br/>
Change the Theme (under "Theme")<br/> 
Save & Load level (under "File") <br/>

In order to run the server - please run "Runner.java" (located under PTM2 -> server package ) and then run the client (using the Main.java under PtmClient -> application package).
